This interface to ONP generates pages directly from the dictionary’s database. The text generated here is Unicode/UTF-8 and uses HTML semantic tagging where possible. Where a definition is only in Danish it will appear in this colour and when clicked will use Google Translate to generate an English translation. Where there are definitions in both Danish and English, the two versions are separated by // . A green headword in the headword list is one which has been semantically analysed or structured in some form (English and/or Danish definitions, or structure only) and published.

Searches: most searches are accent- and case-insensitive and can use the wildcard characters _ (underscore) for any letter or % for any number of letters. The advanced word search is found under words .
